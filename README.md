# SPREAD Fairness

We do it for a fair world and therefore we are **boosting the real decentralization** of the _Cardano_ blockchain in two ways:
1. Developing this Software to **help delegators** to decentralize ADA.
2. We support the network by operating a **single stake pool** [[SPRD]](https://adapools.org/pool/2064da38531dad327135edd98003032cefa059c4c8c50c2b0440c63d). Single stake pool operators are guaranteeing that there is no concentration of ADA stake.

# Software

We support true decentralization, this means pushing single pool operators. The unique advantage of our software is for small and big delegators to have guaranteed rewards and support true decentralization:
1. Brings awareness
   1. The software shows the true decentralization potential and helps to choose a pool for delegator
1. Helps choosing a pool
   1. Over 2000 registred stake pools are a lot. No doubt, itâ€™s a hard choice if you need to pick one. SPRD is a tool to make the choice simpler and faster.
1. Ensures delegators rewards
